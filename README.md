Use this tool at your own discretion bearing in mind Twitter's terms of service and Darius
Kazemi's "Basic Twitter bot Etiquette":

This script makes use of Twitter Lib by Bradley Momberger and implements some concepts
inspired by or borrowed from Darius Kazemi and Martin Hawksey.

# BizTwitterBot

A tool for making a twitter bot using Google Spreadsheets. Because the software runs in Google Spreadsheets, and it requires the interaction of a specifically-constructed sheet with the underlying code specific to that sheet, this GitHub repo exists

- to point to the current, legacy, and in-development versions of the spreadsheet
- to share the underlying code in a canonical way
- to use <a href="http://github.com/zachwhalen/ssbot/issues">the issues tracker</a> for support and bug reports

The `.gs` files in this repository are the underlying GAS code for the dev version.

## Spreadsheet Releases

To use one of these spreadsheets, use "File -> Make a Copy..." to save it to your Google Drive.

### Current

Will be updated in a couple days with the correct link.

<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets">SSBot v0.6.</a>

## Setup

A step-by-step guide for the legacy version is available <a href="http://www.zachwhalen.net/posts/how-to-make-a-twitter-bot-with-google-spreadsheets-version-04/
">on Zach Whalen's website</a>.
